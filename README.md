# MQ2CC

This plugin is a project designed for allowing EQEMU community members and server owners to experiment with adding player classes beyond the core 16 classes.
This plugin is UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- and is merely one component to overcome the hurdles of getting new player classes working on the client.

## Getting Started

Include this plugin as you would with any other plugin in MacroQuest.

-- Add it to the plugins folder.

-- Include it to the MacroQuest solution.

-- Set the branch to emu

-- Compile as Release Win32


```txt
/plugin MQ2CC
```

### Commands

While on the Character Creation screen, use CTRL+~ key combination to open the console.
Use /plugin cc, /plugin cc unload, or /plugin cc toggle.
More information about this plugin is under the hood - check out the solution and attach the client to Visual Studio to debug further.
